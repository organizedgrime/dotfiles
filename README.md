### TODO
Modify nvim config to allow for certain keybinds outside of the rust ecosytem.
There are more languages that we want to us `;;` as a binding for, and want to keep that in mind. Same with telescoping stuff.

Additionally, we'd like to introduce some setup scripts to get us up and running in new environments quickly.

Particularly, we want a minimum neovim install, as well as a way to introduce the more fully featured version.

So far we like chezmoi, but looking at the way sstelfox does his install scripts makes us optimistic about custom tooling in the future. Still indecisive.
